Members: 
@Carl Colburn
@Dinu Thakur

@Shane Nguyen
@Subha Barakoti

Decription:
Electic vehicles and their future state in society.
    
Questions:
Does cost of manufacturing impact purchasing demographics?
Is there a cost benefit of going electric vs. staying fuel?
Can the infrastructure sustain demand?
Is there a carbon offset benefit?

Datasets:
Data.gov / dmv registration information 
Map points of charge points/locations
Sales by model in USA 

Tasks:
Datamining - Sean, Carl, David J.
Scribing/organization - David J., Subha
Dataframing - David J., Carl, Shane
Visualizations - Shane, Sean, Subha
Presentation - Sean, Dinu, (@everyone)

EV
    Finance - cost of manufacturing costs
    carbon offset
    cost of electricity v. cost of fuel
    demographics
    data.gov / dmv registration information 
    map points of charge points/locations
    sales by model in USA 

Notes/Hypothesis:
Range Anxiety has an impact on EV buying decisions i.e. brand/model
    Charge stations saturation helps ease making
        long range has less saturation v. short range with more saturation
Avg. msrp per brand for 2022, compared to max range per brand, does that correlate to demand of any specific brand in total sales?
Millenials drive market demand in electric vehicle purchases.
People who make more than the US median income are more likely to buy an EV.

    line plot for comparison between vehicle types

Price points (KBB)
    Avg MSRP to compare EV v. Non EV to correlate against registration counts to help determine if price drives EV demand
