Can the infrastructure sustain demand?
Is there a carbon offset benefit?

Data.gov / dmv registration information 
Map points of charge points/locations
Sales by model in USA

EV
    Finance - cost of manufacturing costs
    carbon offset
    cost of electricity v. cost of fuel
    demographics
    data.gov / dmv registration information 
    map points of charge points/locations
    sales by model in USA 

Notes:
Does range have an impact on buying decisions i.e. brand and or price?
Avg. msrp per brand for 2022, compared to max range per brand, does that correlate to demand of any specific brand in total sales?
What age groups who drive demand i.e. Millenials etc.?
What is the income demographic?

Add in YoY growth %
    line plot for comparison between vehicle types

Price points (KBB)
    Avg MSRP to compare EV v. Non EV to correlate against registration counts to help determine if price drives EV demand
