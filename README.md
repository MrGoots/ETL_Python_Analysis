Project: EV Performace v. Cost Benefit

Members: 
@Carl Colburn
@Dinu Thakur
@sean pratz
@Shane Nguyen
@Subha Barakoti

Decription:
Electic vehicles and their future state in society.
    
Questions:
Does cost of manufacturing impact purchasing demographics?
Is there a cost benefit of going electric vs. staying fuel?
Can the infrastructure sustain demand?
Is there a carbon offset benefit?

Datasets:
Data.gov / dmv registration information 
Map points of charge points/locations
Sales by model in USA 

Tasks:
Datamining - Sean, Carl, David J.
Scribing/organization - David J., Subha
Dataframing - David J., Carl, Shane
Visualizations - Shane, Sean, Subha
Presentation - Sean, Dinu, (@everyone)

EV
    Finance - cost of manufacturing costs
    carbon offset
    cost of electricity v. cost of fuel
    demographics
    data.gov / dmv registration information 
    map points of charge points/locations
    sales by model in USA 

Notes/Hypothesis:
Range Anxiety has an impact on EV buying decisions i.e. brand/model
    Charge stations saturation helps ease making
        long range has less saturation v. short range with more saturation
Avg. msrp per brand for 2022, compared to max range per brand, does that correlate to demand of any specific brand in total sales?
Millenials drive market demand in electric vehicle purchases.
People who make more than the US median income are more likely to buy an EV.


Add in YoY growth %
    line plot for comparison between vehicle types

Price points (KBB)
    Avg MSRP to compare EV v. Non EV to correlate against registration counts to help determine if price drives EV demand

# **Summary**
Here is a brief summary of the process we followed for the Data Analysis of Electric Vehicle and Registration Data.

1. Will have performed below actions on the Data.
*   Load the files using pandas
*   Remediated any missing or incorrect values
2. We have analysed below columns to get meangingful insights out the datasets
*   State
*   Year
*   Electric vehicle utilities
*   No of EV registered per state
*   Electric Range
*   Relationhip between electric eange and base MSRP
4. We have answered below questions to generate insights from the dataset
*   What is the average range improvements by year per electric charge?
*   What is the year on year registration's growth for EV?
*   What is the Top 10 count of registrations per state?
*   What is the EVT Distribution count per state?
*   In which year did EV increase the most?

- The electric vehicle registration dataset contains information on Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) and Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicles (PHEVs), and Hybrid Electric Vehicles (HEVs) registered through Department of Transportation (DOT).

# **Conclusion**

- California is the top state in EV registrations and number of EV chargers.

- From 2016 to 2022 the no of electric vehicles registrations have increased
    - This rate of increase has been greater than the rate of increase in hybrid and plug-in hybrid vehicles consistently over the past 6 years
    - 2021-2022 saw the greatest increase in year on year change for EV vehicles
    - The increase in EV registration is correlated with number of EV chargers and negatively correlated with median charger distance
