347,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for State and Alternative Fuel Provider Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, as amended, certain state
government and alternative fuel provider fleets are required to acquire
alternative fuel vehicles (AFVs) as a portion of their annual light-duty
vehicle acquisitions. Compliance is required by fleets that operate,
lease, or control 50 or more light-duty vehicles within the United
States. Of those 50 vehicles, at least 20 must be used primarily within
a single Metropolitan Statistical Area/Consolidated Metropolitan
Statistical Area, and those same 20 vehicles must also be capable of
being centrally fueled for the fleet to be subject to the regulatory
requirements.

Under [Standard
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/standard-compliance), the AFVs that
covered fleets acquire help them achieve compliance, with each AFV
acquired earning the fleet one AFV-acquisition credit. Covered fleets
may earn additional credits for AFVs earned in excess of their
requirements, and these credits may be banked for future use toward
compliance or traded with other fleets. Additionally, fleets that use
fuel blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) in medium- and
heavy-duty vehicles may earn credits toward their annual AFV-acquisition
requirements. A fleet may also earn credits that may be used toward
compliance or banked once the fleet achieves compliance for investments
in alternative fuel infrastructure, mobile non-road equipment, and
emerging technologies associated with certain electric drive vehicle
technologies.

Fleets may also opt into [Alternative
Compliance](https://epact.energy.gov/alternative-compliance), which
allows fleets the option to choose a petroleum reduction path in lieu of
acquiring AFVs under Standard Compliance. Interested fleets must obtain
from DOE a waiver from Standard Compliance by submitting a plan that
demonstrates a path by which they will achieve a certain level of
petroleum reduction specific to their fleet composition.

357,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Federal Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, 75% of new light-duty
vehicles acquired by covered federal fleets must be alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). As amended in January 2008, Section 301 of EPAct 1992
expands the definition of AFVs to include hybrid electric vehicles, fuel
cell vehicles, and advanced lean burn vehicles. Fleets that use fuel
blends containing at least 20% biodiesel (B20) may earn credits toward
their annual requirements. Federal fleets are also required to use
alternative fuels in dual-fuel vehicles unless the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) approves waivers for agency vehicles; grounds for a waiver
include lack of alternative fuel availability and unreasonable cost (per
EPAct 2005, section 701).

Additional requirements for federal fleets were included in the [Energy
Independence and Security Act of
2007](http://www.afdc.energy.gov/laws/eisa), such as fleet management
plans and petroleum reduction from 2005 levels (Section 142), low
greenhouse gas (GHG) emitting vehicle acquisition requirements (Section
141), and renewable fuel infrastructure installation requirements
(Section 246). For more information, see the [Federal Fleet
Management](https://federalfleets.energy.gov/) website.

To track progress toward meeting AFV acquisition and fuel use
requirements, federal fleets must report on their percent alternative
fuel increase compared to the fiscal year 2005 baseline, alternative
fuel use as a percentage of total fuel consumption, AFV acquisitions as
a percentage of vehicle acquisitions, and fleet-wide miles per gasoline
gallon equivalent of petroleum fuels.

Executive Order 13834, issued in May 2018, requires the Secretary of
Energy (Secretary), in coordination with the Secretary of Defense, the
Administrator of General Services, and the heads of other agencies as
appropriate, to review the existing federal vehicle fleet requirements.
In April 2019, the Secretary provided a report to the Chairman of the
Council on Environmental Quality and the Director of the Office of
Management and Budget detailing opportunities to optimize federal fleet
performance, reduce associated costs, and streamline reporting and
compliance requirements. Specifically, the report recommends that
federal agencies identify and implement strategies to:

-   Right-size the fleet
-   Reduce vehicle miles traveled
-   Implement more fuel efficient vehicles
-   Align the implementation of AFVs and associated fueling
    infrastructure

Executive Order 14008, issued in January 2021, requires the Chair of the
Council on Environmental Quality, the Administrator of General Services,
and the Director of the Office and Management and Budget, in
coordination with the Secretary of Commerce, the Secretary of Labor, the
Secretary, and the heads of other relevant agencies, to assist the
National Climate Advisor in developing a comprehensive plan to

358,US,Vehicle Acquisition and Fuel Use Requirements for Private and Local Government Fleets,"Under the Energy Policy Act (EPAct) of 1992, the U.S. Department of
Energy (DOE) was directed to determine whether private and local
government fleets should be mandated to acquire alternative fuel
vehicles (AFVs). In January 2004, DOE published a final rule announcing
its decision not to implement an AFV acquisition mandate for private and
local government fleets. In response to a March 2006 ruling by a U.S.
District Court, DOE issued a subsequent final rulemaking on the new
Replacement Fuel Goal in March 2007, which extended the EPAct 1992 goal
to 2030. The goal is to achieve a domestic production capacity for
replacement fuels sufficient to replace 30% of the U.S. motor fuel
consumption. In March 2008, DOE issued its determination not to
implement a fleet compliance mandate for private and local government
fleets, concluding that such a mandate is not necessary to achieve the
Replacement Fuel Goal. For more information on the Private and Local

vehicles may comply with the ZEV requirements through multiple
alternative compliance options that include producing low emission
vehicles and obtaining ZEV credits. Manufacturers with annual sales of
4,500 vehicles or less are not subject to this regulation.

CARB's emissions control program for MY 2017 through 2025 combines the
control of smog, soot, and greenhouse gases (GHGs) and requirements for
ZEVs into a single package of standards called Advanced Clean Cars. In
December 2012, CARB finalized new regulatory requirements that allow
vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S. Environmental Protection
Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to serve as compliance with
California's adopted GHG emissions requirements for those same model
years.

The accounting procedures for MY 2018-2025 are based on a credit system
as shown in the table below. The minimum ZEV requirement for each
manufacturer includes the percentage of passenger cars and light-duty
trucks produced by the manufacturer and delivered for sale in
California. The regulation also includes opportunities for compliance
with transitional zero emission vehicles, which must demonstrate certain
exhaust emissions standards, evaporative emissions standards, on-board

limited to, the number of AFVs and hybrid electric vehicles acquired,
the locations of the alternative fuel pumps available for those
vehicles, and the total amount of alternative fuels used. Vehicles the
state owns or leases that are capable of operating on alternative fuel
must operate on that fuel unless the alternative fuel is not available.
DGS is also required to:

-   Take steps to transfer vehicles between agencies and departments to
    ensure that the most fuel-efficient vehicles are used and to
    eliminate the least fuel-efficient vehicles from the state's motor
    vehicle fleet;

2004 and subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and
medium-duty passenger vehicles meeting specified exhaust standards. The
LEV II standards represent the maximum exhaust emissions for LEVs, Ultra
LEVs, and Super Ultra LEVs, including flexible fuel, bi-fuel, and
dual-fuel vehicles when operating on an alternative fuel. MY 2009 and
subsequent model year passenger cars, light-duty trucks, and medium-duty
passenger vehicles must meet specified fleet average greenhouse gas
(GHG) exhaust emissions requirements. Each manufacturer must comply with
these fleet average GHG requirements, which are based on California Air
Resources Board (CARB) calculations. Bi-fuel, flexible fuel, dual-fuel,
and grid-connected hybrid electric vehicles may be eligible for an
alternative compliance method.

In December 2012, CARB finalized regulatory requirements, referred to as
LEV III, which allow vehicle manufacturer compliance with the U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency's GHG requirements for MY 2017-2025 to
serve as compliance with California's adopted GHG emissions requirements
for those same model years.

In August 2022, CARB approved LEV IV standards, which updates
regulations for light- and medium-duty internal combustion engine
vehicles by reducing allowable exhaust emissions and emissions caused by
evaporation. LEV IV also changes the calculation procedure for new
vehicle fleet-average emissions and prohibits zero emissions vehicles
from being considered in fleet-average emissions calculations by MY
2029.

6606,OR,Clean Transportation Fuel Standards,"The Oregon Department of Environmental Quality (DEQ) administers the
Oregon Clean Fuels Program (Program), which requires fuel producers and
importers to register, keep records of, and report the volumes and
carbon intensities of the fuels they provide in Oregon. Phase 2 of the
Program, implemented in 2016, requires fuel suppliers to reduce the
carbon content of transportation fuels.

In 2020, a new goal was implemented to reduce the carbon content of
transportation fuels by 20% below 2015 levels by 2030, and 25% below
2015 levels by 2035.

DEQ must conduct rulemaking for the Program to support greater electric
vehicle (EV) adoption. DEQ must also develop a
[method](https://goelectric.oregon.gov/our-strategy) to aggregate and
monetize all eligible EV credits in the Program to assist in achieving
the state goal of 50,000 registered EVs in Oregon by 2020. For more

commercialization of ZEVs in California. In particular, the Air
Resources Board, Energy Commission (CEC), Public Utilities Commission,
and other relevant state agencies must work with the private sector to
establish benchmarks to achieve targets for ZEV commercialization and
deployment. These targets include:

-   By 2020, the state will have established adequate infrastructure to
    support one million ZEVs;
-   By 2025, there will be 1.5 million ZEVs on the road in California
    and clean, efficient vehicles will displace 1.5 billion gallons of
    petroleum fuels annually;
-   By 2025, there will be 200 hydrogen fueling stations and 250,000
    electric vehicle (EV) chargers, including 10,000 direct current fast
    chargers, in California;
-   By 2030, there will be 5 million ZEVs on the road in California; and
-   By 2050, greenhouse gas emissions from the transportation sector
    will be 80% less than 1990 levels.

State agencies must also work with their stakeholders to accomplish the
following:

-   Develop new criteria for clean vehicle incentive programs to
    encourage manufacturers to produce clean, affordable cars;
-   Update the 2016 ZEV Action plan, with a focus on low income and
    disadvantaged communities;
-   Recommend actions to increase the deployment of ZEV infrastructure
    through the Low Carbon Fuel Standard;
-   Support and recommend policies that will facilitate the installation
    of EV infrastructure in homes and businesses; and
-   Ensure EV charging and hydrogen fueling are affordable and
    accessible to all drivers.

The ZEV promotion plan additionally directs the state fleet to increase
the number of ZEVs in the fleet through gradual vehicle replacement. By
2020, ZEVs should make up at least 25% of the fleet's light-duty
vehicles. Vehicles with special performance requirements necessary for
public safety and welfare are exempt from this requirement. For more

charging and hydrogen, propane, and natural gas fueling infrastructure
along national highway system corridors. To designate these Alternative
Fuel Corridors (AFC), FHWA solicits nominations from state and local
officials and works with other federal officials and industry
stakeholders.

FHWA must establish an AFC [grant
program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12730) to award grants to eligible
entities, by November 15, 2022. During the designation and redesignation
process, in consultation with the U.S. Department of Energy, FHWA will
issue a report identifying charging and fueling infrastructure, best
practices and guidance for predictable infrastructure deployment,
analyzing standardization needs for fuel providers and purchasers, and
reestablishing the goal of achieving strategic deployment of fueling
infrastructure in the designated corridors.

For the [2023 Request for Nominations
(RFN)](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/alternative_fuel_corridors/nominations/2023_request_for_nominations_r7.pdf),
state and local officials must submit nominations to FHWA by June 21,
2023. State and local agencies can nominate additional corridors, extend
currently designated corridors, nominate a different fuel(s) along an
already designated corridor, and/or update the status of previously
designated corridors.

The Round 7 RFN and AFC designation is tied to funding eligibility under
the [NEVI Formula Program and the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure
Discretionary Grant Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12744). The
FHWA encourages nominations that focus on EV charging infrastructure
along Interstate corridors, but nominations may also be submitted
elsewhere on the National Highway System. Corridor projects along Round
7 AFCs are not eligible for the [2023 Notice of Funding Opportunity for
the Charging and Fueling Infrastructure Discretionary Grant
Program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12732), which closes June 13,
2023. When considering Round 7 nominations, FHWA strongly encourages
segments of Interstates that do not currently have an EV designation,
particularly longer Interstate segments that provide important through
connectivity to adjoining States.

FHWA is also requesting input on proposed Freight EV Corridors
designation, outlined in the Round 7 RFN.

12744,US,National Electric Vehicle Infrastructure (NEVI) Formula Program,"The U.S. Department of Transportation's (DOT) Federal Highway
Administration (FHWA) NEVI Formula Program will provide funding to
states to strategically deploy electric vehicle (EV) charging stations
and to establish an interconnected network to facilitate data
collection, access, and reliability. Funding is available for up to 80%
of eligible project costs, including:

-   The acquisition, installation, and network connection of EV charging
    stations to facilitate data collection, access, and reliability;
-   Proper operation and maintenance of EV charging stations; and,
-   Long-term EV charging station data sharing.

EV charging stations must be non-proprietary, allow for open-access
payment methods, be publicly available or available to authorized
commercial motor vehicle operators from more than one company, and be
located along designated FHWA [Alternative Fuel
Corridors](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/11675) (AFCs). If a state and
DOT determine that all AFCs in the state have been fully developed, then
the state can propose alternative public locations and roads for EV
charging station installation.

FHWA must distribute the [NEVI Program Formula Program
funds](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/bipartisan-infrastructure-law/evs_5year_nevi_funding_by_state.cfm)
made available each fiscal year (FY) through FY 2026, so that each state
receives an amount equal to the state FHWA funding formula determined by
23 [U.S. Code](https://www.govinfo.gov/) 104. To receive funding, states
must submit plans FHWA and the [Joint Office of Energy and
Transportation](https://driveelectric.gov) for review and public posting
annually, describing how the state intends to distribute NEVI funds. The
FHWA announced [approval of all initial state
plans](https://www.fhwa.dot.gov/environment/nevi/ev_deployment_plans/)
on September 27, 2022. State NEVI plan updates are due August 1, 2023.

Additionally, DOT established a [grant
program](https://afdc.energy.gov/laws/12732) for states and localities
requiring additional assistance to strategically deploy EV charging
stations under this Program. Additional funding eligibility and
considerations will apply.
